# sudoku-app
This repository contains a Sudoku game implementation built  using   java  on netbeans platform  . 
Java Swing have also used here to build the GUI of this game.
Java Swing is a part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) which is used to create window-based applications.
i have used jFrame technolodgy here.
 JFrames are top-level containers provided by Java Swing which provide a playground for designing components. JFrames are also known as base windows on which other components such as menu bars, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc. rely. Almost every Java Swing application starts with the JFrame window.
 so here is the final project User Interface. Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle, where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits without repetition.

 Solution Checker: Users can check their progress by verifying whether their current puzzle configuration is a valid solution.
